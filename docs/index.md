# HashiCorp Consul Service on Azure (HCS) Provider

The HCS provider provides resources to manage [HashiCorp Consul Service on Azure](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul/service-on-azure) (HCS) clusters.

## Authenticating to Azure
The HCS provider supports the same authentication methods as the [Azure provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/2.40.0/docs#authenticating-to-azure).

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Configure the provider
provider "hcs" {}

// The HCS provider works great with resources provisioned via the Azure provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

// If you have not already done so, accept the HCS Marketplace agreement
data "hcs_plan_defaults" "hcs_plan" {}

resource "azurerm_marketplace_agreement" "hcs_marketplace_agreement" {
  publisher = data.hcs_plan_defaults.hcs_plan.publisher
  offer     = data.hcs_plan_defaults.hcs_plan.offer
  plan      = data.hcs_plan_defaults.hcs_plan.plan_name
}

// Create an Azure Resource Group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "hcs-tf-example-rg"
  location = "westus2"
}

// Create an HCS cluster Azure Managed Application.
resource "hcs_cluster" "example" {
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  managed_application_name = "hcs-tf-example"
  email                    = "me@example.com"
  cluster_mode             = "production"
}
```
